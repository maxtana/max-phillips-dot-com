        <h1>About me</h1>

        <p>The path that led me to start this blog is a diverse one. I’ve interviewed local artists, musicians and business owners as cohost and producer of the video podcast Creatively Wired. I cofounded the coworking space The Candy Factory in downtown Lancaster. As co-owner of the creative firm Not Bad Design I was part of the team that created complete marketing solutions — including branding ID, websites and promotional videos —  for local nonprofits. I was coproducer for the short documentary “Buy Fresh, Buy Local, By Lancaster.” I have performed in various local, regional and national films, commercials, television shows, and theatrical productions.</p>

        <p>I have served on the boards for the theater troupe Creative Works of Lancaster, Pride Lancaster, and Pride Buffalo. I was a producer and director for the web series “Losing Liam,” and worte, produced, and directed my first short film, <em>I Know Where The Bodies Are</em>. in 2017.</p>
